# vocabLite

The goal of this project is to create a landing page for a repository of vocabularies following the vocab.linkeddata.es style

Usage: java-jar vocab.jar -i input repository folder [-o outputDirectoryPath -n name of the repository -oops]

The oops flag will complete an evaluation with oops as with vocab. At the moment this is not implemented.


See an example of a repository using VocabLite: https://idafensp.github.io/WICUS

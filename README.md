# vocabLite
The goal of this project is to create a landing page for a repository of vocabularies following the vocab.linkeddata.es style

Until the first official release I will keep the latest jar on the main branch

Usage: java-jar vocab.jar -i input repository folder [-o outputDirectoryPath -n name of the repository -oops]

The oops flag will complete an evaluation with oops as with vocab. At the moment this is not implemented.
